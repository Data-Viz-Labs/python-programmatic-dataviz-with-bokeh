# Python and Bokeh Learning Materials

This repository contains educational materials for learning data visualization in Python using Bokeh. These notebooks are designed to be run in Google Colab, making them easily accessible for students without requiring local installation of Python or any dependencies.

## Overview

These materials cover fundamental concepts of interactive data visualization using Python's Bokeh library. The exercises are hands-on and interactive, allowing you to experiment with different visualization techniques and understand their applications in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

1. Click on the "Open in Colab" badge above to open the notebook in Google Colab
2. If prompted, sign in with your Google account
3. Save a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive to keep your work
4. Install required dependencies:
   ```python
   bokeh==3.6.2
   bokeh_sampledata==2024.2
   numpy==1.26.4
   yfinance==0.2.52
   ```
5. Execute the cells and follow the instructions within the notebook

## Prerequisites

- A Google account to access Google Colab
